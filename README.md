Project 5 Public API Requests

In this project, I was required to retrieve data from a url and convert that data to visible html using the Fetch API.
Sample HTML was given.
The url comes from the randomuser API which gives a list of random employees with details.
Each employee is placed within a card on the page. Once a card is clicked, a modal is displayed with more details about that employee.

For extra credit, I've added two features to the project along with styling the old premade project.
First, I attached functional arrows on each modal which will cycle through the current employees on the page.
Second, a search bar was added to the page which will filter through all the current employees by the users key input.
